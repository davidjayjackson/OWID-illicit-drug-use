## mental-health-as-risk-for-drug-dependency
* http://ourworldindata.org
* Quote: Increased risk of developing an illicit drug dependency or abuse disorder in individuals with a
given mental health disorder, relative to those without. A value of 3.9 for PTSD, for example,
would indicate that individuals with PTSD are 3.9 times as likely to develop drug dependency
relative to those without.

```{r}
rm(list=ls())
mental_head_risk <- read.csv("./DATA/mental-health-as-risk-for-drug-dependency.csv")
colnames(mental_head_risk) <- c("Disorder","Risk")
```

## Plot Mental Health Risk 

```{r}
mental_head_risk  %>% ggplot() + geom_col(aes(x=reorder(Disorder,Risk),y=Risk)) +
  coord_flip() + labs(title="Mental Health as Risk For Drug Dependency",
                      x="Mental Disorders")
